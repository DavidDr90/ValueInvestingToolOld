# sec-crawler
use python to crawl through EDGAR SEC website and auto download financial reports


this repo is designed to function as a sub module in other financial projects. Please check out https://github.com/coyo8/sec-edgar, I have shamlessly borrowed some chunks of code from there, and modified it to fit my needs.
